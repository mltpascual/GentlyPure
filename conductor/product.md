# Product — Gently Pure

## One-Line Description

Gently Pure is a skincare brand landing page that showcases a line of gentle, natural skincare products designed for sensitive skin.

## Problem Statement

People with sensitive skin struggle to find skincare products they can trust. Most brands overwhelm with complex ingredient lists, aggressive marketing, and unclear product differentiation. There is a need for a calm, trustworthy digital presence that communicates gentleness, transparency, and efficacy without the noise.

## Solution Approach

A single-page, editorial-style landing page that embodies the brand's philosophy of simplicity and care. The design uses warm, earthy tones and generous whitespace to create a calming experience that mirrors the product's gentle nature. Every section is crafted to build trust — from transparent ingredient showcases to real customer transformation stories.

## Target Users

**Primary Persona — "The Conscious Consumer"**: Women aged 25–45 with sensitive or reactive skin who research ingredients carefully before purchasing. They value transparency, sustainability, and brands that feel authentic rather than corporate. They are willing to pay a premium for products that genuinely work without irritation.

**Secondary Persona — "The Gift Giver"**: Friends or family members looking for a safe, premium skincare gift for someone with sensitive skin. They need clear product differentiation and trust signals to make a confident purchase decision.
