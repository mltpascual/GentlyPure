# Product Guidelines — Gently Pure

## Brand Voice

Gently Pure speaks with **quiet confidence**. The tone is warm, knowledgeable, and reassuring — never clinical, never aggressive. The brand communicates like a trusted friend who happens to be a skincare expert: approachable yet authoritative, gentle yet decisive.

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Warm | Inviting and personal, never corporate | "Your skin deserves kindness" not "Our products deliver results" |
| Transparent | Honest about ingredients and processes | "We use only 7 ingredients — here's why each one matters" |
| Calm | Unhurried, spacious language | "Take a moment for your skin" not "Act now!" |
| Confident | Assured without being boastful | "Crafted for sensitive skin" not "The best for sensitive skin" |

### Tone Spectrum

The brand tone shifts subtly depending on context:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Hero / Headlines | Poetic, aspirational | "Where nature meets nurture" |
| Product Descriptions | Informative, specific | "Lightweight daily moisturizer with ceramide complex" |
| Testimonials | Authentic, conversational | "My skin finally feels like itself again" |
| FAQ / Support | Helpful, clear | "Most customers see improvement within 2–4 weeks" |
| CTAs | Inviting, gentle | "Discover our range" not "Buy now" |

## Terminology and Glossary

| Term | Usage | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Formulation | Preferred over "formula" or "recipe" | Formula, mixture, concoction |
| Sensitive skin | Always lowercase, no scare quotes | "Sensitive" skin, problem skin |
| Gentle | Core brand word, use frequently | Mild, soft, weak |
| Natural | Use when referring to ingredient sourcing | Organic (unless certified), chemical-free |
| Nourish | Preferred verb for moisturizer benefits | Fix, repair, correct |
| Botanical | Preferred adjective for plant-based ingredients | Herbal, plant-y |

## Error Message Conventions

Error messages should maintain the brand's calm, helpful tone:

| Scenario | Message |
|---|---|
| Invalid email | "That doesn't look quite right — please check your email address" |
| Form submission failed | "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again in a moment" |
| Page not found | "We can't find that page, but we can help you find what you're looking for" |
| Out of stock | "This product is taking a rest — sign up to be notified when it returns" |

## User-Facing Copy Standards

Headlines should use Fraunces (serif) and be concise — ideally under 8 words. Body copy should use Karla (sans-serif) and be written at a 7th-grade reading level for accessibility. Section labels use uppercase tracking (`text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.2em]`) as a design convention. Numbers should use words for one through nine and numerals for 10 and above. Prices should always include the currency symbol and two decimal places ($38.00, not $38).

## Documentation Style

Technical documentation (README, DESIGN.md, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) uses a professional, precise tone. Code comments should be concise and explain "why" rather than "what." Commit messages follow conventional commits format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`.
